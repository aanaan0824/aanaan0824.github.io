## A Brief Intro



> *A naive sophomore, an economist in the future, a Marxist, and a dreamer.*



Six months ago, I wrote these words with the utmost enthusiasm, and then I realized I was too young and naive.



However, it doesn't matter. People are always disenchanted with the world and constantly reaping surprises. I only pray that I will keep my original wish and stay firm.



This site stores my work in progress, thoughts on reality, and endless fantasies.



> *TRUE LOVE IS POSSIBLE*
>
> *ONLY IN THE NEXT WORLD --FOR NEW PEOPLE*
>
> *IT IS TOO LATE FOR US*
>
> *WREAK HAVOC ON THE MIDDLE CLASS*



I will fight until the last moment.

## Work in Progress



**You know I haven't got any!** 😭



OK, I'm trying.



Some notes on learning R language: [Learning R Language](https://annan21.notion.site/Learning-R-Language-8b2c714a870c410f80a7582343881a5a).



Some notes in Chinese Society: [Chinese Society](https://annan21.notion.site/bdc57e423d794f989519d52f14fb7675).



Some thoughts about my SRT program: [bank credit + Bartik IV](./Pages/Bank_Firm_Credit___Bartik.pdf).



I gradually find that most of my work could not be posted on this website. 🤔 I will store those inconsequential things here then. Umm... Some day when I finally write my own paper I will put them on the webpage.
