# A Brief Introduction



> *A naive sophomore, an economist in the future, a Marxist, and a dreamer.*



Six months ago, I wrote these words with the utmost enthusiasm, and then I realized I was too young and naive.



However, it doesn't matter. People are always disenchanted with the world and constantly reaping surprises. I no longer care whether I can get into a famous university or a glamorous job. I only pray that I will keep my original wish and stay firm.



This site stores my work in progress, thoughts on reality, and endless fantasies.



> *TRUE LOVE IS POSSIBLE
>
> ONLY IN THE NEXT WORLD --FOR NEW PEOPLE
>
> IT IS TOO LATE FOR US
>
> WREAK HAVOC ON THE MIDDLE CLASS*



I will fight until the last moment.
