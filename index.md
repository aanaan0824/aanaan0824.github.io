## A Brief Intro



> *A naive sophomore, an economist in the future, a Marxist, and a dreamer.*



Six months ago, I wrote these words with the utmost enthusiasm, and then I realized I was too young and naive.



However, it doesn't matter. People are always disenchanted with the world and constantly reaping surprises. I only pray that I will keep my original wish and stay firm.



This site stores my work in progress, thoughts on reality, and endless fantasies.



> *TRUE LOVE IS POSSIBLE*
>
> *ONLY IN THE NEXT WORLD --FOR NEW PEOPLE*
>
> *IT IS TOO LATE FOR US*
>
> *WREAK HAVOC ON THE MIDDLE CLASS*



I will fight until the last moment.



> 一点浩然气，千里快哉风。



## Who am I?



Here is my [CV](https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/f522eca9-9aa1-4573-964d-14fbbbbf41ed/Anns_Resume.pdf?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Content-Sha256=UNSIGNED-PAYLOAD&X-Amz-Credential=AKIAT73L2G45EIPT3X45%2F20230323%2Fus-west-2%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20230323T105336Z&X-Amz-Expires=86400&X-Amz-Signature=f9e65d7d193e8584d85847815c5ff1a92ab0e22e580af37617a395753fdb15ea&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&response-content-disposition=filename%3D%22Ann%27s%2520Resume.pdf%22&x-id=GetObject).





## Work in Progress



**You know I haven't got any!** 😭



OK, I'm trying.



Some notes on learning R language: [Learning R Language](https://annan21.notion.site/Learning-R-Language-8b2c714a870c410f80a7582343881a5a).



Some notes in Chinese Society: [Chinese Society](https://annan21.notion.site/bdc57e423d794f989519d52f14fb7675).



I gradually find that most of my work could not be posted on this website. 🤔 I will store those inconsequential things here then. Umm... Some day when I finally write my own paper I will put them on the webpage.
