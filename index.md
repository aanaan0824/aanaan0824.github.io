# A Brief Introduction

> A naive sophomore, an economist in the future, a Marxist, and a dreamer.



Six months ago, I wrote these words with the utmost enthusiasm, and then I realized I was too young and naive.



However, it doesn't matter. People are always disenchanted with the world and constantly reaping surprises. I no longer care whether I can get into a famous university or a glamorous job. I only pray that I will keep my original wish and stay firm.



This site stores my work in progress, thoughts on reality, and endless fantasies.



> TRUE LOVE IS POSSIBLE

> IT IS TOO LATE FOR US

> WREAK HAVOC ON THE MIDDLE CLASS



I will fight until the last moment.



> 一点浩然气，千里快哉风。
