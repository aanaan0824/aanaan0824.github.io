This is a page where I record my second journey in Martinaise. If you don't know where it is, buy a Disco Elysium on steam. You'll come back and thank me.



On my first journey, I chose the Thinker version. Although LOGIC and ENCYCLOPEDIA helped me to understand the history of this land quickly, I missed too many chances to feel the pulse of this city and the mood of my companions. (especially for my doomed cyber wife Jean Vicquemare)

So, this time I take the route of the Sensitive. Since I have known most of the story, I'm in no hurry to finish the game. So, I have time to perfect my travel notes. I hope I could gain a lot from this trip, no matter it is thinking about the source of this story or spiritual comfort.



If you are a fan of Disco, come on! Don't hesitate to have fun with me!
